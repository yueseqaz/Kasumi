## 📌 Available Scripts  

### 1. [ban-devtool](https://github.com/yueseqaz/js-repo/blob/main/bandevtool.js) 🚫🔍  
`ban-devtool` is a lightweight script designed to enhance the security of your website by preventing debugging attempts. It automatically disables developer tools and redirects any debugging attempts to a default URL or `#`.  

⚠ **Note:** This script provides a basic level of protection but is not foolproof. Advanced users may still find ways to bypass it, so use it as an additional security layer rather than a sole defense mechanism.  

#### ✅ How to Use  
Simply include the script in your webpage:  
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/yueseqaz/js-repo@main/bandevtool.js"></script>
